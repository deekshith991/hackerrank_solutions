# hackerrank_solutions

This repo contains the problems that i have solved till today 

**(CPP)[./cpp]** : this folder contains the cpp basic path

**NOTE :** If u compile the code the compiler may spit a lot of **ERRORS**as the most of them are written in the platform inbuilt ide and not on my machine **But functions INDIVIDUALLY work**.

The structure of the repo may change.
